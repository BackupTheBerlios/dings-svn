		<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> can display statistics about the entries in the learning stack. Most of the statistics are static and show the current distribution of entries for a criteria. E.g. the following screenshot shows the distribution of entries over the scores. The more you learn the better your score should become (see <a href="site:learningalgo">learning algorithm</a>).</p>
		<figure src="images/stats_scores.png" alt="screenshot of DingsBums?! showing statistics over the distribution of scores" />
		<p>To be able to see the evolution of the number of entries and the average score over the learning period a chart with time series statistics can be shown (see below). There are two possibilities to save the current statistics for later comparision in a time series:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Save the current statistics whenever you want: use menu <code>Tools -&gt; Save current Learning Statistics</code>.</li>
			<li>Save the statistics whenever you quit the program: configure this in the <a href="site:preferences">Preferences</a>.</li>
		</ul>
