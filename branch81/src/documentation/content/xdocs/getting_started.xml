			<title>Starting with a New Learning Stack</title>
			<p>To start with a new learning stack just use menu <code>file -&gt; New</code> or the button at the bottom right. You can leave everything as defaults and go directly to <code>Edit -&gt; Edit Entries</code> to add a few entries to the learning stack. Only the fields &quot;Base&quot; and &quot;Target&quot; are required. &quot;Target&quot; is what you want to memorize by using the <a href="site:learning">learning</a> features.</p>
			<note>If &quot;Base&quot; and &quot;Target&quot; is all you are interested in the you can hide the other fields in the &quot;Visibility&quot; tab in the learning stack properties (see <a href="site:preferences">Preferences and Properties</a>).</note>
			<p>See <a href="site:editing">editing</a> for more information about how to add contents to your learning stack and the terminology used.</p>
