				<td><a href="samples/english_chinese.xml">english_chinese.xml</a></td>
				<td>Short English to Chinese vocabulary</td>
				<td>Very basic setup with syllables highlighting and only default entry type, unit, category etc.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="samples/eucapitals.xml">eucapitals.xml</a></td>
				<td>The countries of the European Union as of the 1st of April 2004</td>
				<td>Extensive use of type and global attributes, but only one entry type. Makes extensive use of the possibility to define labels per field.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><a href="samples/german_danish.xml">german_danish.xml</a></td>
				<td>German to Danish vocabulary</td>
				<td>Uses different entry types per word category (verbs, nouns etc.), each having one or more entry type attributes. Has a learning history to test statistics. This learning stack exemplifies how the software can be adapted to a specific need, in this example the Danish grammar. Also the level of detail chosen is for a highschool student. The same vocabulary for undergraduates or to prepare for a single trip to Denmark would use much less details - probably only the actual German words with the Dansih translation and no grammatical details.</td>
