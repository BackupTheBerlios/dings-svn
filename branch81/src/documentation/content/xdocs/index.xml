			<title><code>DingsBums?!</code> is Discontinued - Moving to Anki</title>
			<warning label="DingsBums?! is discontinued">Some of the ideas will be moved to Anki, which is mature and has support for amongst others mobile devices. Anki is open source, too. You can continue to use DingsBums?! as long as you like and move to Anki, when you are ready.</warning>
			<figure src="images/anki-logo.png" alt="Anki home page" />
			<p><a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a> runs on all major operating systems, is in my view slick and nice and has both many users and contributors. I have decided to discontinue <code>DingsBums?!</code> due to lack of time to implement synchronisation with web, mobile devices etc. - something which <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a> already has.</p>
			<p>Instead I will contribute to <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a> and port some of the more <a href="site:learningchoice">game-like features</a> of <code>DingsBums?!</code>.</p>
			<p>See <a href="site:anki">Moving to Anki</a> for how to automatically transform your <code>DingsBums?!</code> learning stacks to the <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki/">Anki</a> format. <a href="site:anki">Moving to Anki</a> also explains the main differences in concept and vocabulary between <code>DingsBums?!</code> and Anki.</p>

			<title>Is this for you?</title>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> is written with flexibility in mind. So it can be adapted to many different needs. It is open source and you can therefore try and later use it free of charge. If you miss a feature in the current version, then there is a chance that it is a <a href="site:features">planned feature</a>.</p>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> is for you if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you want to be able to memorize stuff in the classical way (item by item)</li>
				<li>you would like to have the possibility to define the level of details by yourself. E.g. grammatical details for language training depend both on your skill level and the actual language. <code>DingsBums?!</code> supports both sophisticated categorization / level of details and a very basic approach.</li>
				<li>a bit of fun should be part of learning. <code>DingsBums?!</code> provides different help methods for <a href="site:learning">learning one by one</a> plus four <a href="site:learningchoice">game-like learning environments</a>.</li>
				<li>learning statistics is something you are looking for.</li>
				<li>the application should present the hard to remember items more often then the ones you already know by heart. After all the computer should both help you to save time and make learning less boring, shouldn&apos;t it?</li>
				<li>you want to define the learning items yourself - no matter whether you are learning the stuff or you are a teacher.</li>
				<!--<li>a mixture of languages and bi-directional text is a must-have.</li>  -->
				<li>you want to be able to learn in both directions. E.g. in a French - English learning stack you can test both from French to English and from English to French.</li>
				<li>you need support for <a href="site:syllables">syntax highlighting of syllables</a>, e.g. for simplified Chinese using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_yin">pinyin</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> in its current form and within the next releases is not for you if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you need a predefined stack of learning items, e.g. an English - French vocabulary. Although the community could provide this in the future, you cannot rely on it.</li>
				<li>you want to have audio support. <code>DingsBums?!</code> in its current form is only about memorizing visually (reading and eventually writing). Audio support is a feature with low priority, so do not rely on it in the near future.</li>
				<li>you need extensive support for conjugation</li>
				<li>you are a teacher and want to have a framework to write exercises and tests.</li>
				<li>you need PDA or mobile phone support right now. </li>
				<li>a great looking application is more important to you then functionality. I know that <code>DingsBums?!</code> needs som final touch.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If <code>DingsBums?!</code> is not for you, you might find a better suited software on the <a href="site:links">links</a> page.</p>
