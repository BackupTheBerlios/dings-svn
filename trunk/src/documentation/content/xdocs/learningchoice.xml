			<p>All learning is done in menu <code>Learn</code>. &quot;Learning by choice&quot; means learning several entries in a learning stack at the same time by picking or matching a question with an answer. This gives the possibility to learn in three game-like environments.</p>

			<p>When starting learning a dialog is presented to allow you to choose the learning direction. E.g. in a vocabulary you do not want to learn always from German to Danish, but also from Danish to German (however the entry type details will alway be of the target.</p>
