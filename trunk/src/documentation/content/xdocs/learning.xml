			<title>Introduction</title>
			<p>All learning is done in menu <code>Learn</code>. At the moment you can only learn one entry at a time. In the future learning games will allow to make learning more fun and give a better start. E.g.:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose the right solution among 4 possible solutions</li>
				<li>Memory (the pattern card game)</li>
				<li>Matching words: two rows of words where you drag lines between the original and the translation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When starting learning a dialog is presented to allow you to choose the learning direction. E.g. in a vocabulary you do not want to learn always from German to Danish, but also from Danish to German (however the entry type details will alway be of the target.</p>
