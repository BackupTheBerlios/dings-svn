			<title>About</title>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">flashcard</a>-like learning tool that can be used for any kind of content, which can be memorized using flashcards, including vocabularies. <code>Dingsbums?!</code>aims to be an application which makes memorizing both fun and efficient.</p>
			<p>See <a href="site:features">features</a> for an extensive overview, take a look at the <a href="site:screenshots">screenshots</a>, or <a href="site:download">download</a> it right away and try one of the <a href="site:samples">samples</a> right away. If you have <a href="http://java.com/">Java</a> installed just press the launch button below:</p>

			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> is an <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source</a> development project, released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL license</a>.</p>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> is written in Java and runs therefore on the most popular operating systems including Linux, MacOS X, Windows and Solaris.</p>

			<title>Is this for you?</title>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> is written with flexibility in mind. So it can be adapted to many different needs. It is open source and you can therefore try and later use it free of charge. If you miss a feature in the current version, then there is a chance that it is a <a href="site:features">planned feature</a>.</p>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> is for you if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you want to be able to memorize stuff in the classical way (item by item)</li>
				<li>you would like to have the possibility to define the level of details by yourself. E.g. grammatical details for language training depend both on your skill level and the actual language. <code>DingsBums?!</code> supports both sophisticated categorization / level of details and a very basic approach.</li>
				<li>a bit of fun should be part of learning. <code>DingsBums?!</code> provides different help methods for <a href="site:learning">learning one by one</a> plus four <a href="site:learningchoice">game-like learning environments</a>.</li>
				<li>learning statistics is something you are looking for.</li>
				<li>the application should present the hard to remember items more often then the ones you already know by heart. After all the computer should both help you to save time and make learning less boring, shouldn&apos;t it?</li>
				<li>you want to define the learning items yourself - no matter whether you are learning the stuff or you are a teacher.</li>
				<!--<li>a mixture of languages and bi-directional text is a must-have.</li>  -->
				<li>you want to be able to learn in both directions. E.g. in a French - English learning stack you can test both from French to English and from English to French.</li>
				<li>you need support for <a href="site:syllables">syntax highlighting of syllables</a>, e.g. for simplified Chinese using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_yin">pinyin</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p><code>DingsBums?!</code> in its current form and within the next releases is not for you if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>you need a predefined stack of learning items, e.g. an English - French vocabulary. Although the community could provide this in the future, you cannot rely on it.</li>
				<li>you want to have audio support. <code>DingsBums?!</code> in its current form is only about memorizing visually (reading and eventually writing). Audio support is a feature with low priority, so do not rely on it in the near future.</li>
				<li>you need extensive support for conjugation</li>
				<li>you are a teacher and want to have a framework to write exercises and tests.</li>
				<li>you need PDA or mobile phone support right now. The possibility to use a PDA or the mobile phone to memorize stuff while sitting in the bus, waiting in the restaurant etc. is a high priority for me, too. Due to time restrictions I cannot tell when I will implement this - it won't happen in 2006.</li>
				<li>a great looking application is more important to you then functionality. I know that <code>DingsBums?!</code> needs som final touch.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If <code>DingsBums?!</code> is not for you, you might find a better suited software on the <a href="site:links">links</a> page.</p>

			<title><code>DingsBums?!</code> 0.4.4 released</title>
			<p>Version 0.4.4 is a minor update in the 0.4.x series. The most important three new changes are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Added support for accent caron in syllables highlighting for e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_yin">pinyin</a>.</li>
					<li>Added support for character input panel for syllables in learn one by one view.</li>
					<li>Fixed visibility of fields in edit entry and learn one view, when they should not be shown. You might need to correct the visibility settings in the learning stack properties for fields, which should not be displayed.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>See <a href="site:changes">changes</a> for a full list over the updates and additions since the last version.</p>
			<p>The next major release will support pictures and figures besides text for the target information.</p>
			<p>If you want to influence which features get implemented first, or if you have an idea for a new feature, then please have a look at the <a href="site:features">features</a> list. Feel free to <a href="site:contact">contact</a> me.</p>
